# ðŸŽ® RufflePad
Interface between Javascript game pad methods and ActionScript 2 "ExternalInterface" for use with the Ruffle Flash emulator.

- Uses the well-documented Javascript Game Pad API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API

- Gamepad layout follows the standard found here: https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/#remapping

- To view and edit the AS2 code within output.fla (which compiles to output.swf) you will need a copy of the Flash IDE (I use cs5.5)

- Consider uploading your resulting project file(s) to Newgrounds for the Flash Forward Jam!

- Note: To test locally, you must serve the files over a local web server (Ruffle limitation).
